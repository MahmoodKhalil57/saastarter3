# component-factory — the build that lives OUTSIDE the site

The site (`docs/`) has no build step, ever. This workspace is where the
one-time builds happen instead: components authored in framework
languages are compiled into self-registering custom-element artifacts at
`docs/js/components/*.gen.js`, then committed like any other file. Run
it when a source here changes; nothing in deployment or serving depends
on it.

```bash
cd component-factory
bun install
bun run build      # → docs/js/components/counter-*.gen.js
```

The compiler itself is the npm package
[hono-aep-webc-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hono-aep-webc-factory);
this directory is only sources + `webc.config.json`. To pull in a
component you did NOT write:

```bash
bun add react-select
bunx webc-factory wrap react react-select --tag s2-select --build
```

There is a FIFTH React path that deliberately isn't here:
`docs/js/components/react-jit/` ships React components as source with a
lazy shared engine — no build at all. Rule of thumb: one-off React
component → compile it here (self-contained, works offline); several
React components or community npm components → react-jit (one shared
runtime, esm.sh ecosystem access).

## Invariants the build enforces (build.ts)

- `#stores` and `nanostores` are EXTERNAL — resolved at runtime through
  the page import map so every artifact shares the site's single atom
  instances. Bundling them would silently fork cross-engine state.
- Framework runtimes are BUNDLED — an artifact is one file, resolvable
  by a browser, no npm at runtime.
- `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `"production"`, Vue feature flags are set.
- Every artifact gets a provenance banner; `.gen.js` files are never
  edited by hand.

Weight is visible in the build output on purpose — each artifact carries
its runtime, so N react artifacts = N copies of React. That trade is the
whole reason react-jit exists.

The artifact contract itself (tags, state, theming, light DOM) lives in
`docs/js/components/README.md` — a factory source must obey it like any
hand-written component.
